# Voice-activated-arduino-blinds-using-bluetooth-project

In this project, we created a voice-activated system using dc motor leveraging an Arduino and bluetooth module that helps in automation of blinds. The main feature that these blinds have is the ability to open and close them from an app. This project features voice control and the ability to control individual motors allowing us to open one blind at a time.
